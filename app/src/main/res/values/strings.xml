    <string name="msg_demo_pagination">This is a demo of how you can do a list pagination with Rx. We page 10 items at a time and there are 55 items altogether</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_volley">This is a Volley request demo</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_concurrency_schedulers">This is a demo of how long running operations can be offloaded to a background thread. After the operation is done, we resume back on the main thread. All using RxJava! \n\n To really see this shine. Hit the button multiple times and see how the button click which is a ui operation is never blocked because the long operation only runs in the background</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_buffer">This is a demo of how events can be accumulated using the "buffer" operation. Tap the button below repetitively and you will notice in the logs that button taps are collected over a span of 2s and printed below.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_debounce">As you type in the input box, it will not shoot out log messages at every single input character change, but rather only pick the last one.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_timeout">This is a demo of terminating events, that take too long to process. Events in this demo should timeout in 3 seconds. Button 1 is an event that takes 2s to process, and Button 2 is a n event that takes 5s to process. Hit Button 2, and see in the logs that it\'s been cancelled, while this is not the case for Button 1.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_retrofit">Retrofit from Square is a super easy networking helper library. It works really well with RxJava and these are examples taken from Jake Wharton\'s talk at Netflix (see README). Really the only interesting bits here are in the code and logs.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_retrofit_async_task_death">This shows how you can replace an AsyncTask with RxJava. The interesting parts are in the code.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_doublebinding">Watch how the result gloriously auto-updates <ba></ba>sed on your changing inputs. Using a technique like this, you could achieve the two-way binding in Angular Js, or more efficiently use a pattern like the Presentation View Model.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_polling">Demo polling or making a call repeatedly with RxJava.\n\nSimple polling: Notice in the logs how a (simulated) network call is repeatedly made in the background.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_exponential_backoff">These two examples demonstrate retrying and executing with a delay using an exponential backoff strategy.</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_rxbus_1">Tap on the below button and RxBus will listen to the events</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_form_comb_latest">Monitor the state of multiple observables with the combineLatest operator. Only after all the 3 inputs contain valid entries will the submit button light up</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_timing">BTN 1: run single task once (after 2s complete)\nBTN 2: run task every 1s (start delay of 1s) toggle \nBTN 3: run task every 1s (start immediately) toggle \nBTN 4: run task 5 times every 3s (then complete) \nBTN 5: run task A, pause for sometime, then proceed with Task B</string>
    <string name="msg_demo_rotation_persist">This is an example of starting an Observable and using the result across rotations. There are many ways to do this, we use a retained fragment in this example</string>

    <string name="msg_pseudoCache_demoInfo_concat">Concat merges the results sequentially. But notice that the latter subscription starts only AFTER the first one completes. Some unnecessary waiting there.</string>
    <string name="msg_pseudoCache_demoInfo_concatEager">Concat eager is cooler. Both subscriptions start at the same time (parallely) but the order of emission is respected.</string>
    <string name="msg_pseudoCache_demoInfo_merge">Merge presents the result as they come in which is great if the disk is *always* faster. If not, you have problems.</string>
    <string name="msg_pseudoCache_demoInfo_mergeSlowDisk">Here\'s a fake example where the disk is made slower than the network call. You can see the results are whack.</string>
    <string name="msg_pseudoCache_demoInfo_mergeOptimized">This is an optimized merge and probably want to use. Notice subscriptions happen immediately and network results are respected regardless of when they come in. So if the disk is slower, it is discarded.</string>
    <string name="msg_pseudoCache_demoInfo_mergeOptimizedSlowDisk">Similar to optimized merge (same code). Notice though that if the disk is slower it\'s discarded in favor of the "fresh" network data which in this case happens to be faster.</string>
